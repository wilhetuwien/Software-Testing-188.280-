## Host can be IPv4address
##  IPv4address = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
## or a registrated name that begins and ends 
## with an alphanumerical character. 
## Each domain label is seperated by ".".
## In rfc1034 there is specified what is required for a domainname

Domain: example., tuwien., is., 0., A1., a-a.,
