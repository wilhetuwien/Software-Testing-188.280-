Specification of Equivalence Partitions and Boundary Values for RingBuffer(int capacity)

(1) Valid and Invalid Equivalence Partitions

// todo: list all valid and invalid partitions for the parameter capacity in form of ranges of int values 

[0 .. 2147483647] -> valid 
An array can be of size 0 and in this case the parameter is passed as an int which is 32 bit
[-2147483648 to  .. -1] -> invalid
Arrays can not be initialized with negative values and throws and error
Values outside these ranges throws compile time errors.


(2) Refined Equivalence Partitions for Valid Partitions

// todo: list all partitions exhibiting equivalent behavior within the partition of valid values

[0] -> Is both full and empty at the same time. Crash when enque.
[1] -> Two states: full, empty. Allows enqueing.
[2 .. 2147483647] -> Three states: empty, not empty and not full, full. Allows enqueing.
